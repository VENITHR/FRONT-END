<p text="red">The region was ruled by several empires, including the three great empires â€“ Chera, Chola and Pandyan, which shape
 the region's cuisine, culture, and architecture. After the fall of Kingdom of Mysore,
the British Colonial rule during the modern period led to the emergence of Chennai, then known as Madras, as
a metropolitan city. Modern-day Tamil Nadu was formed in 1956 after the reorganisation of states on linguistic lines.
The state is home to a number of historic buildings, multi-religious pilgrimage sites, hill stations and three 
World Heritage Sites.
